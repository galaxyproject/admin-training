# Common `galaxy.ini` Tweaks

# Configuring Internal HTTP Server

In `galaxy.ini`:
* `[server:main]` contains basic internal HTTP server configuration
  * `port = 8080` change to set the port binding.
  * `host = 127.0.0.1` change to IP of listening network interface, or `0.0.0.0` for all network interfaces.
  * `use_threadpool = True` change to create a new thread per request.
  * `threadpool_workers = 10` set to number of threads in threadpool.
  * `threadpool_kill_thread_limit = 10800` time in seconds to wait before killing a thread.
* Multiple `[server:XYZ]`
  * You can define additional e.g. `[server:web1]` sections.
  * Just be sure to change `port` and/or `host` values.
  * Can run them all with `GALAXY_RUN_ALL=1 sh run.sh --daemon`
  * But using Supervisor and uWSGI is a better idea.

# Configuring the Galaxy Application

In `galaxy.ini`:
* `[app:main]` contains application configuration
  * `filter-with = gzip` uncomment to enable internal gzip compression.
  * Uncomment `filter-with = proxy-prefix` and set `prefix` in `[server:]`if running Galaxy away from webserver root.
  * If running more than 1 Galaxy, set `cookie_path` to match `prefix`.
  * `database_connection` contains the SQLAlchemy connection string for database.

# Securing your Object IDs

In `galaxy.ini`:
* User facing object IDs
  * Galaxy uses the Blowfish cipher to obscure integer IDs.
  * Prevents guessing the hashes for various Galaxy objects.
  * `id_secret` is used as the Blowfish key.
  * Changing `id_secret` is highly recommended.
  * Changing `id_secret` will change & invalid existing URLs (e.g. datasets, histories, workflows, etc).
* Try changing the `id_secret`. What happens?

# Update the welcome page

Welcome page is `$GALAXY_ROOT/static/welcome.html` and is the first thing that
users see. It is a good idea to extend it with things like:
- Downtimes/Maintenance periods
- New tools
- Publications relating to your Galaxy

No restarting is necessary.

# Client Browser Security

In `galaxy.ini`:
* `sanitize_all_html` by default, Galaxy sanitizes all "text/html" tool outputs. Setting to False potentially exposes users to XSS attacks.
* `sanitize_whitelist_file` manually override html sanitization for listed tools. Can set in admin interface.

* `allowed_origin_hostnames` Returns Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header that matches the Origin header of the request.
* `use_printdebug` anything "print"ed within a Galaxy Web thread is exposed to user. Set to False in production.
* `use_interactive` Enabled by default. Enable live debugging in your browser.  This should *never* be enabled on a public site.
