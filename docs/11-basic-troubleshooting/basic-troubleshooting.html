# Database migration

In case you see database migration errors during startup you can:

* Check DB table `migrate_version` column `version`.
* Check folder `lib/galaxy/model/migrate/versions/` - the latest migration should match the DB.
* Clean the `*.pyc` files to make sure there is no remnant from other code revisions.
  * Something like `$ find . -name "*.pyc" -delete` should work.

---
# Mako templates

In case you see page inconsistencies or template errors in logs.

* Clean the `*.pyc` files to make sure there is no remnant from other code revisions.
  * Something like `$ find . -name "*.pyc" -delete`.

---
# Client build

In case your javascript/css local changes are not visible.

* JavaScript files are located in `client/galaxy/scripts`.
* CSS files are in `client/galaxy/style/`.
* Check `client/README.md` for details regarding client build.
* Run `$ make client` from root folder.
  * You can also check the `Makefile` in root for other useful targets.

???
* This should only matter when you modify some of the Galaxy's static assets.
* Does not affect javascript or style in mako templates.
