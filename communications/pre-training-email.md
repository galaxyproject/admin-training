Welcome!

The 2021 Galaxy Admin Training is beginning soon and we wanted to give you a couple reminders about the upcoming event!


**Community Requirements**

Everyone is expected to abide by the Code of Conduct (CoC) that you signed before this training. We want this to be a welcoming and friendly environment for everyone! Please see the [VIB CoC](https://www.vibconferences.be/code-of-conduct) for more information and the point of contact for any issues.

**Technical Requirements**

- We will provide VMs for you on which you will do everything during the week, so you don't need a super powerful laptop or anything.
- It is best if you have an SSH client pre-installed, but it is not strictly necessary. All VMs have a terminal available on port 8080.
- Windows users can choose to install [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) or equivalent. For Linux & OSX: You should have an ssh client already installed.

**Educational Requirements**

By the time of the workshop, you should be familiar with the Unix command line. Everyone has a different background and if you haven't had to learn Unix shell basics before that's ok! We recommend that you go through the The Unix Shell lesson from The Carpentries.

Additionally you need to be comfortable with a command-line text editor. If you have not had to use one before, then nano is recommended. If you have a preferred one (e.g. vim or emacs), you are welcome to use that.

**Conversation**

Slack (chat) will be used for communication and support throughout the week. Here you can ask questions about the training, get help when you are stuck, and chat about anything and everything with your fellow participants and the global community of Galaxy instructors. You must join Slack to participate in this event.

**Training Materials**

Everything we teach during the week will be found on the [Galaxy Training Materials](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/admin/) website. If you are worried about the teaching pace of the upcoming week, feel free to read through these materials ahead of time and familiarise yourself with the concepts. Our [preliminary schedule is available](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/training/admin-track), but subject to change.

**Format**
This will be an asynchronous event. This means that all training sessions have been pre-recorded, and you can work through them at your own pace during the training week. A global community of instructors will be available on Slack 24/7 to answer any questions you may have.

So when you are ready to start the training next week, just go to your track, and start from Day 1!

**Certificates**

Certificates of attendance will be available upon request after the training week. More information about this can be found on the training website, but in order to qualify for a certificate, please make sure to work on the VM, actively participate on Slack throughout the week, join all the training channels, answer the daily icebreaker questions, ask lots and lots of questions, give us feedback on each session after you've finished (what did you like? what would you like to see added in the future, etc)!


We hope you are as excited as we are!
