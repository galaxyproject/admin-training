Welcome!

The 2021 Galaxy Admin Training is beginning soon and we wanted to give you a couple reminders about the upcoming event!


**Community Requirements**

Everyone is expected to abide by the Code of Conduct (CoC) that you signed before this training. We want this to be a welcoming and friendly environment for everyone! Please see the [Galaxy Project CoC](https://galaxyproject.org/community/coc/) for more information and the point(s) of contact for any issues.

**Mandatory Pre-Workshop Homework**

This year we are adding the use of `git` to the Galaxy Admin Training learning path. You must be familiar with `git` before you attend the workshop. We suggest you follow [Version Control with Git](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/data-science/tutorials/bash-git/tutorial.html), as it covers all of the necessary concepts

**Technical Requirements**

- We will provide VMs for you on which you will do everything during the week, so you don't need a super powerful laptop or anything.
- It is best if you have an SSH client pre-installed, but it is not strictly necessary. All VMs have a terminal available on port 8080.
- Windows users can choose to install [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) or equivalent. For Linux & OSX: You should have an ssh client already installed.

**Additional Educational Requirements**

By the time of the workshop, you should be familiar with the Unix command line. Everyone has a different background and if you haven't had to learn Unix shell basics before that's ok! We recommend that you go through [this CLI Basics](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/data-science/tutorials/cli-basics/tutorial.html) and [Advanced CLI](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/data-science/tutorials/cli-advanced/tutorial.html) tutorials if you need a refresher.

Additionally you need to be comfortable with a command-line text editor. If you have not had to use one before, then nano is recommended. If you have a preferred one (e.g. vim or emacs), you are welcome to use that.

**Conversation**

Slack (chat) will be used for communication and support throughout the week. Here you can ask questions about the training, get help when you are stuck, and chat about anything and everything with your fellow participants and the global community of Galaxy instructors. You must join Slack to participate in this event.

**Training Materials**

Everything we teach during the week will be found on the [Galaxy Training Materials](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/admin/) website. If you are worried about the teaching pace of the upcoming week, feel free to read through these materials ahead of time and familiarise yourself with the concepts. Our [preliminary schedule is available](https://github.com/galaxyproject/admin-training/tree/2023-gent), but subject to change.

**Certificates**

Certificates of attendance will be available upon request after the training week. 


We hope you are as excited as we are!
