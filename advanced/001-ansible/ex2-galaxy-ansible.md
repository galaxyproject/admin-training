### GATC - 2016 - Salt Lake City

# Setup a production Galaxy with Ansible - Exercise.

#### Authors: Nate Coraor, Enis Afgan, Nuwan Goonasekera, Simon Gladman. 2016

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this tutorial, you should:

1. Have an understanding of how Galaxy's Ansible roles are structured and interact with one another.
2. Be able to use an ansible playbook to install different flavours of Galaxy for different purposes.
3. Be able to write a playbook to suit your own purposes.

## Introduction

In exercise 1 we wrote a role called "galaxy-tool-install" which we then ran to install a few tools to our Galaxy server. In this exercise, we will look at how to combine multiple roles into install a complete production Galaxy server.

Luckily for us, the staff of the Galaxy project have thought about this quite a bit and have written roles for *all the things!* We will be making use of the Galaxy projects pre-written roles and will look at how they are combined in a project.

In this exercise we will:

1. Download an ansible playbook and associated roles.
1. Walk through the various parts including the roles and the playbook.
1. Discuss the group vars file
1. Go through the Ansible "galaxy" - an unfortunate name... (It's Ansible's toolshed.)

## Section 1 - The tutorial script source files.

Go to somewhere sensible on either your local machine or on your Galaxy server (/home/<your_username> would be sensible..)

* Grab the following with wget or curl etc and then untar it.

  `http://schd.ws/hosted_files/gcc16/e2/gcc2016-ansible.tar.gz`

This will copy the entire playbook and associated roles to somewhere we can look at it.

**Part 1 - Examine the playbook**

Have a look at the *playbook.yml* file. You'll notice that it contains quite a number of plays each of which reference a different role/s. The order in which the roles are referenced is important. This playbook does the following:

1. Performs some system tasks (system packages, creates a galaxy user etc.)
1. Installs postgres and nginx
1. Configures postgres
1. Install Galaxy
1. Installs supervisor

You'll notice another play there called *Install Galaxy tools*. This has "tags" set. You'll also notice that it's host is set to localhost. This play won't get run unless you give the `--tags tools` switch to the `ansible-playbook` command line.

Take note of the fact that the playbook combines the individual roles to give us the desired outcome.

**Part 2 - Ansible galaxy**

Where do the roles come from? Ansible has a "toolshed" like system called **Ansible Galaxy** - d'oh.

Open the *commands.txt* file. You'll see a command to run the playbook followed by a series of commands that download the various roles from the Ansible galaxy and put them in an appropriate place in our scripts file tree.. e.g. `ansible-galaxy install -p roles galaxyprojectdotorg.postgresql`

There are many roles available for download. They all have some meta data associated with them which has information on the role's author, keywords, dependencies, licenses, available platforms etc. All of the roles in our script have that information. Checkout the *main.yml* in any of our role's *meta* directory.

The Ansible Galaxy can be browsed at: [http://galaxy.ansible.com/](http://galaxy.ansible.com/)

**Part 3 - Browse the roles**

The demonstrator will now work through a couple of the roles and will run the playbook on a machine for us.

The roles that this playbook use are:

| Order run | Role name | Purpose | Variables to consider |
| --------- | --------- | ------- | --------------------- |
| 0 | global_vars | Set some variables for the entire playbook | galaxy_server_dir, galaxy_changeset_id |
| 1 | galaxyprojectdotorg.postgresql | Installs postgreSQL database server.| postgresql_backup_local_dir |
| 2 | galaxyprojectdotorg.nginx | Installs and configures nginx (web server) |  |
| 3 | natefoo.postgresql_objects | Installs postgreSQL scripts to work with privileges etc. |  |
| 4 | galaxyprojectdotorg.galaxy | Installs and configures Galaxy | galaxy_server_dir, galaxy_vcs (git or hg) |
| 5 | supervisor | Installs supervisor configs for Galaxy | . |

You'll note that these roles all have pretty good documentation on how to use them, which variables to set and how, and when they should be used. This makes it all much easier to understand.

Have a look at each of the roles in turn, concentrating mainly on the variables (in the defaults/main.yml files and the vars directory if present.) By modifying these variables, you can customise things like, where postgrSQL keeps it's backups, where Galaxy is installed and many others.

**Part 4 - Run the playbook**

To save everyone doing this, the demonstrator will run the role in the class. Ofcourse, you can run this role anytime you like later on.

To run the role we will need a Linux instance (we will use ubuntu 16.04) with a set public/private keypair. We will also need to know it's ip address.

* Set all the variables in *group_vars/galaxy_servers.yml* as follows:

``` yaml
galaxy_user: galaxy

postgresql_objects_users:
  - name: galaxy

postgresql_objects_databases:
  - name: galaxy
    owner: galaxy

galaxy_server_dir: /srv/galaxy/server
galaxy_vcs: git
galaxy_changeset_id: release_16.04

galaxy_config:
  "app:main":
    database_connection: postgresql:///galaxy
    admin_users: nate@bx.psu.edu     # <---- Put your user email here
    tool_dependency_dir: /srv/galaxy/deps
  "uwsgi":
    processes: 1
    socket: 127.0.0.1:4001
    pythonpath: "{{ galaxy_server_dir }}/lib"
    threads: 4
    master: True

nginx_configs:
  - galaxy

supervisor_configs:
  - galaxy

```

* Set the contents of the *inventory* file appropriately.

``` ini
[galaxyservers]
<instance_ip> # <---- The ip address of your machine

[vars]
ansible_user=ubuntu
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=<path_to_your_private_ssh_key>

```

Now it's just a matter of making sure the public key is in the ssh authorised keys list on the target instance and then running:

`ansible-playbook -i inventory -vv playbook.yml`

Once again, the `-vv` switch indicates that we want the 2nd level of verbosity.. It is a handy one to have if you want to see what is going on. Another thing I regularly do is tee the screen output to a log file so I can keep a record of how the Ansible ran.

To do this, use the following command:

`script -q -c "ansible-playbook -i inventory -vv playbook.yml" /dev/null | tee ansible-build.log`

Use `less -R` to view the file with the colours set.

The Ansible script will run and display what it's doing as it does. (Always a good idea to run it in a screen or something since networks are sometimes flaky!)


## So, what did we learn?

Hopefully, you now understand:
* How Ansible combines roles with a playbook
* Where to go to get more roles to add to a playbook
* How to install Galaxy on a machine using Ansible.
