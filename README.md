## Location, Logistics, and Registration

**This training will be offered 2-6 March at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es/).**

See the [workshop's Galaxy Community Hub page TODO](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2020-03-admin/) for details on logistics and registration.

## Training VM instances

Galaxy training instances will be bootstrapped with [a small Ansible playbook](/bootstrap-instances), which you may find useful for repeating the exercises at home using a VM, Docker image, etc.

### Tuesday
**18th April**

Today we pivot to focus on making that server useful: adding tools and data, configuring quotas and authentication

The last day! We made it. Today we have some additional topics, some of which are not admin related. Please feel free to leave at any point in the day and go enjoy Barcelona if the topics are maybe a bit less interesting for you.

# After the Training

Everything you were taught in the past few days can be found in the [admin section](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/) of the Galaxy Training Materials.

For those of you who also need to do some Galaxy development, there is a [dev section of training materials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/) for those topics as well. There you can learn to integrate webhooks and tours, and learn about advanced tool development. For those who need to [teach Galaxy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/instructors/) or want to [contribute training materials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/contributing/), we have lots of tutorials for you!
