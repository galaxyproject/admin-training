# After the Training

Everything you were taught in the past few days can be found in the [admin section](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/) of the Galaxy Training Materials.

For those of you who also need to do some Galaxy development, there is a [dev section of training materials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/) for those topics as well. There you can learn to integrate webhooks and tours, and learn about advanced tool development. For those who need to [teach Galaxy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/instructors/) or want to [contribute training materials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/contributing/), we have lots of tutorials for you!

**For your Users**

We recommend setting the `helpsite_url` in your Galaxy configuration to point to [https://help.galaxyproject.org/](https://help.galaxyproject.org/) where users can go and chat with each other. It's a great resource to help your users be independent and self-sufficient in their Galaxy learning. Admins are welcome too!

And don't forget that many, many [training materials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/) already exist covering different areas of \*omics and other research done with Galaxy. This can be a great resource for either giving training courses to your users (join the train-the-trainer session at GCC if you want to learn more) or to just point users to as a self-directed learning resource.

If you're asked to provide training infrastructure for your users, but do not have the capacity to support this, UseGalaxy.eu provides [training infrastructure](https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas) for free.
